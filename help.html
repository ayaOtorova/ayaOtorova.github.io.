      Sales speak volumes so if you purchase diverse books, it tells the publishers that there is a demand for them. If the author has a good sale on their first book they are more likely to sell the second one and get a higher advance.

      Don’t read diverse books because you think you should. Reading them should not be seen as spinach. Read whatever genre you like! The book doesn’t have to be necessarily focused on diversity. It could be focused on something else and the characters just happen to be diverse.
