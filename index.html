        <ul class="ye">
          <li>I love reading, however, most of the books in the library are about the same type of people and the books given to us at school are all written about the same demographic: white people.</li>
         <li>I feel like having more representation allows POC to feel more integrated in society as well as allows those who are not POC to see things from their point of view and understand their struggles better.</li>
